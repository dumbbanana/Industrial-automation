# CONVEYOR BELT - 4

Design a control circuit to operate a conveyor belt which can be started and stoped at anytime with 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons.
- The conveyor should stop operating when it detects a box/package at the end of the line 
- It should be also able to start/restart from button on remote panel. (refer the figure below)

START button and REMOTE START button are in paraller (i.e OR logic), Therefore triggering either of the buttons will activate the circuit.
