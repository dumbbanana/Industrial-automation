# CONVEYOR BELT - 1

Design a control circuit to operate a conveyor belt which can be started and stoped at anytime with 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons. The conveyor should stop operating when it detects a box/package at the end of the line (refer the figure below)

When the sensor is high or the stop button is pushed to unlatches the 1st relay, thereby resetting the entire circuit to original state (OFF).
